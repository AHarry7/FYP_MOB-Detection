    Open fypreact folder in vscode. 
    Make sure you are inside the fypreact directory. 
    Now run the command: npm install
    For example your fypreact folder is inside a folder named project inside drive G. 
    You first need to get inside this directory in the terminal with the command
    cd G:\project\fypreact and then run the command npm install
    
    Now get inside yolov5 directory by doing the same and run the command: pip install -r requirements

    Open fypreact and yolov5 both directories in VScode side by side in separate windows.

    In yolov5 window terminal, run the command: uvicorn fast_api:app reload

    In fypreact window terminal, run the command yarn start

   Upload any image from dataset for detection.
