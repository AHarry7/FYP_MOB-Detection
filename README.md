# MOB-Detection
Creating a control system that uses drones and artificial intelligence to provide safety to large vessels. Some work has been done on this which uses detection of people by analyzing images recorded with thermal. In ours, we are going to use video cameras and then process those images for the detection of people through deep learning.
The “Search and Rescue System Using Aerial Imagery” is a man overboard detection
project aimed at providing an automated and reliable solution for detecting a person
overboard in water bodies. The project leverages machine learning techniques to
analyze aerial imagery to detect the presence of a person in the water and alerts the
relevant authorities for a quick rescue response. This project is designed to minimize
response time and improve the chances of saving lives in emergency situations.
